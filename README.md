# ME!
- 👋 Hi, I’m @PreciousFood
- 🍔 Food is indeed precious. 
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and stuff. I mostly have done python. I don't have the patience to really learn anything ese.
- 🎲 These repositories are just a bunch of random code I've thrown together. I am really really really bad at finishing stuff...
- 🏁 I have one project that is (maybe?) finished [here](https://github.com/PreciousFood/ASCII_PyGraphics)
